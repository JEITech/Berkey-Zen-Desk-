<h1>Viewing intent: <span id="intentName"></span></h1>
<!--<button onclick="publishAllChanges()">Publish Changes</button>-->
<h3>Utterances:</h3>
<p>Utterances are the trigger phrases that the bot will pick up on to determine a customers intent.
    These do not have to be exact matches, as artificial intelligence is used to match similar statements to existing utterances.
    These work best when they are no longer than 2-3 words.

<ul id="utterances">

<h3>Response:</h3>
<p>A response is made up of 5 message groups.  Each message group can contain up to 5 messages.  
    One message from each group is chosen at random for each response.  A message group will only be saved if there is a message in that group.
